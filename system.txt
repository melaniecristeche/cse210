Version control software keeps track of every change to the code and coders can work as a team 
with a synchronized document posted on a database. All kinds of mistakes or desire to go back to
 earlier projects it can be done, developers can do it and compare earlier versions of the code 
 to help with any problem they may have. 
It is important to have a version to control and change your projects, but what is the most common
 way to accomplish that? Well, a repository, or Git project, contains the entire collection of files 
 and folders of any project, along with each file's correction history. 
To use Git, it is essential to use characteristic commands to modify your project, copy it, etc so it
is important to know how to manage those commands. 
The current directory can be seen by typing the command "pwd". And you can change directories by using 
the "cd" command and then by using the name of the directory to change to.
