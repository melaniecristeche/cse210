What is a version control system is and why is it important.?

Version control software keeps track of every change to the code and coders can work as a team 
with a synchronized document posted on a database. All kinds of mistakes or desire to go back to
 earlier projects it can be done, developers can do it and compare earlier versions of the code 
 to help with any problem they may have. 
It is important to have a version to control and change your projects, but what is the most common
 way to accomplish that? Well, a repository, or Git project, contains the entire collection of files 
 and folders of any project, along with each file's correction history. 
To use Git, it is essential to use characteristic commands to modify your project, copy it, etc (Git init, 
Git clone, Git status, Git add, Git commit, Git push) so it is important to know how to manage those commands. 

How did you use a version control system to develop the programs?

I used the Version Control system to copy my tic tact toe game project file into the repository. First I created a 
new repository called "cse210" through the interface in my personal account in GitHub, and then I copied it and push
 it the files into that repository.
